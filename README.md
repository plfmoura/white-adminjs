We encounter a hard difficult to add new components and make some changes in base adminJS application. Maybe the doc examples not be clear to create our custom CRM APP.

### timeline events:

- [x] add adminjs base template
- [x] remove adminjs unusable features
- [x] connect with mongoose ORM
- [x] do some resources to check db integrity
- [ ] add new custom components (we break here)⚠️
