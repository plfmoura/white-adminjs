**Project status**: We encounter a hard difficult to add new components and make some changes in base adminJS application. Maybe the doc examples not be clear to create our custom CRM APP.

### timeline events:

- [x] add adminjs base template
- [x] remove adminjs unusable features
- [x] connect with mongoose ORM
- [x] do some resources to check db integrity
- [ ] add new custom components (we break here)⚠️

### How to install and deploy that:

STEP 1: `git clone https://github.com/plfmoura/white-adminjs.git`

STEP 2: `cd white-adminjs`

STEP 3: `npm install`

STEP 4: check `.env.example` file, create your `.env` and run `npm start`

STEP 5: inside `src/constants.ts` you find login credentials.
